Final Project: Clustering of Countries based on Covid-19 indicators
In 2019, the novel coronavirus shook the world. We attempted to find hidden patterns by analysing how we could 
effectively group different countries based on various features like health conditions of people, nourishment 
levels, testing done, access to healthcare etc.by using 2 different clustering algorithms, K-Means and Expectation
Maximization using Gaussian Mixture Models. We are also trying to find out which factors are affecting Covid-19 
cases the most and analyse how the top 5 factors are affecting the Covid-19 cases in different countries.
