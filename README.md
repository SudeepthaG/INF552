# INF552
This repository contains my assignments for the INF-552(Machine Learning for Data Science) course at USC.

It includes the implementation of the following algorithms from scratch along with library implementations
1. Decision Trees
2. K-means algorithm AND the Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering using a
   Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
3. PCA & FastMap
4. Perceptron Learning algorithm, Pocket algorithm, Linear & Logistic Regression
5. Back Propagation algorithm for Feed Forward Neural Networks
6. Support Vector Machines
7. Hidden Markov Model using Viterbi Algorithm

It also includes our final project where we attempted to analyse how we could effectively group different countries 
based on various features like health conditions of people, nourishment levels, testing done, access to healthcare 
etc.by using 2 different clustering algorithms, K-Means and Expectation Maximization using Gaussian Mixture Models. 
We are also trying to find out which factors are affecting Covid-19 cases the most and analyse how the top 5 factors
are affecting the Covid-19 cases in different countries.
